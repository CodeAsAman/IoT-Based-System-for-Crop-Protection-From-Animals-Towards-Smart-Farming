# IoT-Based-System-for-Crop-Protection-From-Animals-Towards-Smart-Farming
No one can imagine a world without agriculture. Due to overpopulation and deforestation, animal interference in residential areas is increasing day by day affecting human life and property, and causing
human-animal conflict. At the present time, farmers in India and other countries are facing a serious
threat from wildlife animals which causes less production in crop yielding. It is not possible to stay in the
field for 24 hours to guard the crops against animals. In spite of good production, the crops on farms are
many times ravaged by animals and it leads to huge losses for the farmers in terms of production, effort,
quality, and money. To overcome this problem, an IoT-based crop protection system is being proposed
in the present work. The system uses a microprocessor and a set of sensors to detect wild animals approaching near the field. The sensor data is analyzed through a machine learning algorithm and helps
the microprocessor to take action. This system helps farmers to protect their crops from animals.
